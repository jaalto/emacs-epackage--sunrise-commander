Description: Emacs implementation of two-pane midnight commander mc(1)
 A two-pane file manager. It's built atop of Dired and takes advantage of
 all its power, but also provides many handy features of its own. It is
 derived mode and can co-exist with other modes. By default it uses only
 one or two buffers open to display panes. Each pane has a history stack to
 traverse directories back and forth.
